TheBook is a command line utility that allows you to SEARCH and READ [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (popularly known as 'The Book' ) from the terminal.
Ever wanted to quickly look up how to spawn threads, or how to define Structs in Rust? TheBook allows you to do so by simply typing `thebook spawn threads` or `thebook structs`.
TheBook renders markdown in the terminal and provides a browser-like experience. It is geared towards Rust beginners who are not quite familiar with the Rust syntax, and Rust experts who want the luxury of typing a few commands in the terminal to look up a certain Rust concept.

If you still prefer the graphical experience of a real web browser, you can use TheBook as a simple 'The Book' launcher. Just run `thebook` in the terminal without any arguments, and 'The Book' will automatically open in your web browser.

TheBook borrows the IMPOSTER_DETECTION_ALGORITHM from [AmongRust](https://github.com/0xhiro/amongrust) for advanced search processing and intelligent query parsing hehe! ඞ :). 

Note: This crate is still new, the results may not be perfect, and the code is a little messy, but hey! it gets the job done :) Please give this project a star on [Github](https://github.com/0xhiro/thebook) and check out [my blog](https://hiro.codes) for fun programming content.

# USAGE

`cargo install thebook`

That's it. you're done. Now run `thebook what you want to search` to search for something or just `thebook` to open 'The Book' in your web browser.
